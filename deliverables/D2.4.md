## Deliverable D2.4: Harmonised Data and FAIR Data Points

**Work Package:** WP2  
**Lead Partner:** KI  
**Date:** 31/10/2024 (Updated May 14, 2025)

---

### Executive Summary

This deliverable outlines how STRATA-FIT partners extracted, harmonized, and validated their local datasets according to a shared schema and prepared them for federated analysis via Personal Health Train (PHT) principles. The previously video-only demonstration has been translated into a detailed, written walkthrough of the harmonization, upload, and validation pipeline.

---

### 1. Harmonisation Goals

The consortium aims to:
- Ensure consistent variable naming, typing, and interpretation across sites.
- Use schema-level validation and version control to enable reproducible analyses.
- Comply with GDPR and the FAIR principles while minimizing data transfer.

---

### 2. Harmonised Schema and Codebook

The data model is managed at:
- [`strata-fit-data-schema`](https://github.com/mdw-nl/strata-fit-data-schema)

**Key features:**
- YAML schema format with ~40 variables
- Constraints: ranges (e.g. age ‚â• 18), regex (e.g. ID format), enumerated values (e.g. sex: 0/1)
- Error messages per field, to support local data cleaning
- Version controlled with GitHub PR reviews

---

### 3. FAIR Principles in Practice

| Principle     | Implementation in STRATA-FIT                               |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Findable**    | Schema hosted in public GitHub; datasets discoverable via node metadata |
| **Accessible**  | Local validator API serves `/schema` and `/validate` endpoints |
| **Interoperable** | All sites use the same variable names, types, and ranges |
| **Reusable**     | Schema versioning + containerized validator ensures consistent parsing |

---

### 4. Scenario: Data Upload and Mounting via MyDRE (VM manager)

**Walkthrough (UMCU node example):**
1. Local user uploads `sample_umc.csv` to the MyDRE web UI (web workspace).
2. File appears in VM‚Äôs `/mnt/data/` directory.
3. Admin logs into server via SSH, escalates to root:
   ```bash
   cd /mnt/data/inbox
   ls  # confirms dataset is present
   ```
4. Admin opens Vantage6 node config file and mounts dataset:
    ```bash
    nano /mnt/config/v6-node-config.yaml
    # Adds entry for 'sample_umc.csv'
    ```
5. Confirms availability via:
    ```bash
    v6 node files
    # checks if /mnt/config/v6-node-config.yaml matches node config
    ```

### 5. Current Consortium Data Summary (May 2025)

| Site          | Total Patients | Total Visits | Data Status           |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|------------------------|
| **UMCU**       | 1,649           | 107,988        | ‚úÖ Validated and mounted |
| **KI**         | 11,192          | 122,818        | ‚úÖ Validated and mounted |
| **MUV**        | 1,941           | 32,703         | üî∂ Mock client tested     |
| **GIMM**       | 619             | 19,559         | ‚úÖ Validated and mounted |
| **LMU**        | ~4,500 (subset) | Unknown        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Text mining in progress |
| **Semmelweis** | ~4,500          | Unknown        | ‚ö†Ô∏è Early-stage extraction |

### 6. Summary and Impact

This deliverable confirms that STRATA-FIT partners:
- Have established a common schema enforced locally via FastAPI-based validation tools
- Use lightweight workflows (e.g., MyDRE + SSH) to securely mount harmonised datasets to Vantage6 nodes
- Can support scalable, privacy-preserving computation without centralising sensitive data

By preparing harmonised data that is **Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)**, STRATA-FIT ensures:
- Compliance with GDPR and ethical standards
- Seamless integration with federated algorithm infrastructure
- A shared data language across sites, accelerating future analytics

---

### 7. Next Steps

To further solidify FAIR compliance and reproducibility:
- Finalize onboarding of remaining partners (e.g., LMU, Semmelweis) into federated network
- Track dataset fingerprints (hashes) linked to schema versions
- Expand validator tooling to cover free-text‚Äìderived variables where possible
