## Deliverable D2.6: Proof-of-Concept Federated Learning Analysis

**Work Package:** WP2  
**Lead Partner:** MDW  
**Date:** 31/10/2024 (Updated May 13, 2025)

### Executive Summary

This deliverable documents a functional proof-of-concept (PoC) of the federated learning system within STRATA-FIT consortium, using real data curated by project partners. It replaces the video-first demonstration with a detailed written walkthrough that describes the technical context, execution scenario, success criteria, and current deployment status.

Our approach adheres to the **Personal Health Train (PHT)** paradigm: each site retains sovereignty over sensitive health data, and Docker-based algorithms ("trains") are sent to compute directly on the data at each node ("station"). This minimizes privacy risks while enabling scalable and GDPR-compliant machine learning.

---

### 1. Demonstration Context and Goals

The purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate that:

- Real STRATA-FIT data, harmonized per [`strata-fit-data-schema`](https://github.com/mdw-nl/strata-fit-data-schema), is accessible via secure federated nodes.
- Nodes can receive, process, and return federated queries using the **Vantage6 infrastructure**.
- Algorithms such as `central_average` execute successfully across real, distributed data sources.

---

### 2. System Overview

- **Infrastructure:** [server / message broker](https://stratafit.prod.medicaldataworks.nl) and nodes at each hospital
- **Authentication:** Admin access controls which algorithm images are permitted at each node.
- **Execution flow:**
  1. Central participant logs in via Jupyter Notebook connected to Vantage6 API.
  2. Pre-approved algorithm Docker image is specified.
  3. Task is dispatched to participating nodes.
  4. Each node computes partial results and returns them.
  5. Central site aggregates results.

### 4. Scenario: Running Federated Queries on Real Data

#### ‚úÖ Use Case: *Average Age and Sex Distribution Across Nodes*

This demo walks through the real-time execution of two algorithm runs:
- `demo_average`: calculates average patient age
- `sex_distribution`: assesses the proportion of male/female patients

**Steps:**
1. Log into Vantage6 collaboration via notebook:
   - Server `stratafit.prod.medicaldataworks.nl`
   - Collaboration includes UMCU, KI, MUW demo nodes, and MDW demo node as aggregator
2. Authenticate and select organization 6 (central coordinator)
3. Specify Docker image and federated task parameters:
   - Example:  
     ```python
     {
       "image": "ghcr.io/mdw-nl/v6-average-py:v1",
       "input": {
         "method": "central_average",
         "kwargs": {
           "column_name": ["Age_diagnosis"],
           "org_ids": [5, 7, 8]
         }
       }
     }
     ```
4. Dispatch task (e.g., task ID `81`)
5. Track results live:
   - UMCU node returns JSON with partial mean + count
   - Other nodes follow as compute capacity allows
6. Verify final average:
   - Aggregated average based on combined weighted sums
   - Example partials:  
     - Node 157: sum = 1566, count = 48 ‚Üí avg = 32.6  
     - Node 159: sum = 945, count = 15 ‚Üí avg = 63

#### üîÑ Re-run for `sex_distribution`:
- Same infrastructure used
- Output shows male (0) / female (1) ratio skewed toward one group (e.g., 0.6)

---

### 5. Challenges Encountered

- **Node congestion**: Some sites (e.g., Vienna) exhibited delay due to load or configuration.
- **Partial failures**: Tasks could get stuck unless monitored or updated.
- **Data overlap**: Some datasets contained multiple rows per patient ID, requiring additional aggregation logic.

---

### 6. Success Criteria

| Metric                             | Met? | Notes |
|-----------------------------------|------|-------|
| Nodes received and processed task | ‚úÖ    | UMCU, KI, MUW all responded |
| Data with proper label was found at each node | ‚úÖ    | UMCU, KI, MUW all responded |
| Output returned and aggregated    | ‚úÖ    | Central node received partials |
| Privacy maintained                | ‚úÖ    | No row-level data or <5 values exposed |
| Algorithm pre-approved per site   | ‚úÖ    | Via node admin config |

---

### 7. Conclusions and Next Steps

This deliverable confirms that STRATA-FIT has:
- A functioning federated learning setup across real patient data
- Vantage6 infrastructure to orchestrate, track, and validate distributed tasks
- Tools and permissions to run real-world analytics without moving data

**Next Steps:**
- Expand to include federated Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier survival models
- Formalize practices for error logging to keep them secure but informative
- Use data validation for inputs and outputs of each function using Pydantic to restrict expected ffunction behavior
- Introduce fairness metrics and performance calibration in future evaluations
